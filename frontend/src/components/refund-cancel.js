            The customer can choose to cancel an order any time before it's
            dispatched. The order cannot be canceled once itâ€™s out for delivery.
            However, the customer may choose to reject it at the doorstep. The
            time window for cancellation varies based on different categories
            and the order cannot be canceled once the specified time has passed.
            In some cases, the customer may not be allowed to cancel the order
            for free, post the specified time and a cancellation fee will be
            charged. The details about the time window mentioned on the product
            page or order confirmation page will be considered final. In case of
            any cancellation from the seller due to unforeseen circumstances, a
            full refund will be initiated for prepaid orders. Techno Computers
            reserves the right to accept the cancellation of any order. Techno
            Computers also reserves the right to waive off or modify the time
            window or cancellation fee from time to time.
